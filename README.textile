h1. tweet tools

This is a simple collection of simple tools for Twitter users:

* Timeline Reversal - this makes it easier to follow individuals who frequently post multi-tweet messages (or plays). With the standard timeline display that most Twitter clients use, having the most recent posts first, their posts could sometimes become difficult to follow.
* Account Rate Limit - displays your account's rate limit
* Friends and Followers Sorting - display friends and followers in alphabetical order (but only per page, unfortunately)
